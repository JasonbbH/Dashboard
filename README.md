# DIY Covid-19 Dashboard Kit

Build and deploy my own Covid-19 Dashboard using iPywidgets, Voila and Binders. Based on UK Government [data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) published by [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england).

I have extracted the number of new cases, cumulative cases, and new deaths and cumulative deaths and new people fully vaccinated by Publish date for England.
